decision trees are a very effective method of supervised
learning. it aims is the partition of a dataset into groups as
homogeneous as possible in terms of the variable to be
predicted. it takes as input a set of classified data, and outputs a
tree that resembles to an orientation diagram where each end
node leaf is a decision a class and each non final node
internal represents a test. each leaf represents the decision of
belonging to a class of data verifying all tests path from the
root to the leaf.
